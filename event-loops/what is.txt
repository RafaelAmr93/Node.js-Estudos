Event-loops
    The event loop is what allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations —
despite the fact that JavaScript is single-threaded — by offloading operations to
the system kernel whenever possible.
    Some async functions can be used to offload other tasks to the browser while
callbacks are called. So the imediate lines of code are executed while the callback
are put on a waiting list to be executed.
    Async function can be pending while the callbacks are executed.
